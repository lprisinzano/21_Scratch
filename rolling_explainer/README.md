Maybe start with the simple rolling from days of yore:



Things to note about rolling cadence:

* we need to cover the full sky at the start of the survey to build up image templates and for proper motion precision

* We need to cover the full sky at the end for proper motions

* We want the "rolling on" to be full observing seaons

* We don't want the "rolling on" to be only the southern sky (this would mean northern telescopes get a tiny fraction of the alert stream)


Under those constriants:  We can have rolling seasons "on" for:

* 1/2 the sky 3 times
* 1/3 the sky twice (or 2/3 of the sky)
* 1/6 of the sky once
